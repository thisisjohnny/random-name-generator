# random-name-generator
Creates random names in bulk. Like 'Lorem ipsum' but for people instead.

## 🚧 Work in progress 🚧
Please excuse the dust while I make this thing actually useful at some point. I'm hoping to add a web interface to accept variable inputs and export the data to a CSV file, or ultimately load the results directly into a Salesforce instance to create demo data.

## With thanks...
This little ditty makes use of the [Random Name Generator API](https://uinames.com). Many thanks to the folks contributing to that amazing tool.
